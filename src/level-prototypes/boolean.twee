:: Boolean:Start

Your notes so far indicate that you need to find Research Lab B, and your explorations have brought you to a room, with a door the North, East and West, a travel chamber in the center, and a desk with a console in the center.

:: Boolean:Start:Console

You a map of the laboratories, showing that:
* Research Labs A and D are to the East
* Research Lab B is to the North
* Research Lab C is to the West

You also see an audio note that reads:
> ''[T-572] Liza'': Ed, I think you're going to be dropping by the labs soon, and since you've forgotten the last few times, just a reminder that the isolation lever in Lab D controls entry to //both// B and C. Be careful with that one -- easy to overexpose yourself.

<<return>>

:: Boolean:TravelChamber

You enter the travel chamber.
<<if $time==0>>
  /* 
  The weird thing about this condition is that it doesn't need to be 
  true necessarily. You could update and observe things in the past, come
  back to the present, and then reasonably safely travel back in time. The
  way you're currently organizing it, you can pretty much only ever
  travel back in time once if you do anything there, which isn't really
  how it's intended. Not a big deal because you can always reset.
  */
  <<if $isLabBLocked === undefined && $isLever1Locked === undefined>>
* [[Travel back in time.|Boolean:Start][$time to -1]]

    The button is a dull gray, clearly disabled.

<<return>>

:: Boolean:LabA

You enter into a room with a door on the East and West side, but the Eastern door has clearly been damaged beyond use. There is a console along the wall with an odd looking lever beside it.

* [[Look at the Console|Boolean:LabA:Console]]
* [[Inspect the lever|Boolean:LabA:Lever]]
* [[Return West|Boolean:Start]]


:: Boolean:LabA:Console

The console has an audio note that reads:
> ''[T-523] Edwin'': L, thanks for the tip about the lever. You're totally right, I almost locked myself out of traveling with that one. But I do need to get into Lab C, so I've jury-rigged another isolation lever to get in. Hope I'm not messing anyone up there. 
/* Also, did you notice the Lab A door is on the fritz? I barely made it in here. I'll put in an order to have that repaired. */

<<return>>

:: Boolean:LabA:Lever

<<if $isLever1Locked===undefined>>
  <<set $isLever1Locked = false>>
<</if>>

The lever has exposed wiring and looks poorly constructed.
* <<link "Pull the lever">>
